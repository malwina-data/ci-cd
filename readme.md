# Log Pattern Search Script

This script is designed to search a log file for a specific error pattern and extract the `.eml` file name found in the context preceding the error. It uses regular expressions to locate the error pattern and retrieve the relevant email name.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pytest` for testing (optional, if you want to run the tests)

Install `pytest` using:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

## Files

- **main.py**: The main script that performs the search and error extraction.
- **test_main.py**: The test script using `pytest` to verify the functionality of `main.py`.
- **test_log.txt**: A sample log file used for testing (will be created during testing).

## Functionality

### `find_context_before_pattern`

This function searches for an error pattern in a log file and extracts the name of the `.eml` file found in the context preceding the error.

#### Arguments:

- `full_path (str)`: Path to the log file.
- `pattern (str)`: The regex pattern to search for the error (default is `ERROR_PATTERN`).
- `context_length (int)`: Number of characters to extract before the matched pattern (default is 200).

#### Returns:

- **Optional[str]**: The name of the `.eml` file, or `None` if no matching error or `.eml` file is found.

#### Example usage:

```python
failed_email = find_context_before_pattern("log.txt")
if failed_email:
    print(f"{failed_email}.eml")
else:
    print("No error pattern or `.eml` file name found in the logs.")
```

## Testing

### 1. **Write a test log**

The test function `test_write_test_log` creates a sample log file (`test_log.txt`) containing a test log.

### 2. **Search for the pattern**

The function `test_in_find` calls `find_context_before_pattern` and asserts that the correct `.eml` file name is found.

### 3. **Test file not found exception**

The `test_file_not_found` function tests the behavior when the log file doesn't exist, ensuring that the script raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

#### Run the tests with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest test_main.py
```

## Example Test Log

```text
email for user9@example.org, attachment 'update_report.pdf' ready.
Email sent to user9@example.org with subject 'Latest Updates'.
Got index name (user9_update.eml).
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'boolean org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1TaggedObjectParser.hasTag(int, int)'
```

This log is used in the tests to check if the script can correctly find the `.eml` file (`user9_update.eml`) by searching for the `ERROR_PATTERN` in the log.

## Error Handling

- **FileNotFoundError**: Raised if the specified log file doesn't exist.
- **RuntimeError**: Raised if any unexpected errors occur during execution.

## Running the Script

To run the script manually:

1. Ensure you have a valid log file with the correct structure.
2. Call the `find_context_before_pattern` function from `main.py` with the log file path as an argument.
3. The script will print the `.eml` file name if found or a message stating no file was found.
